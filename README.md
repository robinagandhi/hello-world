# Hello-World for Gencyber

Hey there! Have you heard about the Cybersecurity program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha? You should check it out! https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/academics/cybersecurity.php

Their student group NuLLIFY hosts a high school CTF competition every year.
You can find more information at http://ctf.nullify.uno/. They will be hosting another high school CTF again this year.
